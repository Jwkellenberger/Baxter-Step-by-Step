# Baxter-Step-by-Step
A step by step walk through and introduction to using Baxter robot.

The links for Baxter SDK and Gazeebo simulation environment are to Rethink Robotics setup instructions.

#### To get started:
- ROS will natively work with python 2.7.
- Rethink Robotics advises ROS Indigo for Baxter.
- [ROS Indigo advises you use Ubuntu 14.04 LTS - ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo)
- [ROS Indigo and Baxter SDK download - Rethink Robotics](http://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/wiki/Workstation_Setup)
- For simulation users only, stop at "Customize the baxter.sh script"
- [Baxter Simulation Gazeebo Environment download - Rethink Robotics](http://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/wiki/Simulator_Installation)
